#Welcome to Collisterator

A micro data service, specializing in customizable lists.

##Why?

It's not always necessary to have a complete backend for every website. Collisterator aims to give you read/write access to any data you can put in a list. [See an example usecase](https://github.com/ageiersbach/movie_list).
